# FishEco
Flocking simulator heavily inspired from BOIDS (BIRD + OID) by Craig Reynolds in 1986, but with fishes and a few personal changes. My goal for this project is to experiment with the flocking system and use an evolutionnary algorithm for the fishes and use cellular automata for the rain drops.
